This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

An app created to visualize some sorting algorithms from T.H.Cormen and Co.'s "Introduction to Algorithms".

I would maybe like to add another component, some sort of stat tracker for array-accesses/comparisons etc. before deploying to github pages in the near future.
